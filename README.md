# Kuehne-Nagel Internship
This internship project consists of two folders: ui and api.

## UI
The ui folder contains the entire frontend of the application, written in React and TypeScript. The code for the frontend can be found in the ui/src directory.

## API
The api folder contains a JSON server that contains all the data for the application.

## Main Work
The main work for this project was done in the ui/src/views/pages/company/job-title directory.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the api directory and run npm install
3. Run npm run json-server to start the json server
4. Navigate to the ui directory and run npm install
5. Run npm start to start the development server
6. That's it! You should now be able to see the application running in your browser.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to Kuehne-Nagel for providing this internship opportunity and for their support throughout the project.
